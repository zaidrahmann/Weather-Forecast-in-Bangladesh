# Weather Forecast in Bangladesh
This project presents a machine learning-based solution for weather forecasting in Bangladesh, focusing on the prediction of rainfall occurrence, rainfall amount, and average daily temperature. We collected and analyzed a decade of weather data from multiple regions from the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/apurboshahidshawon/weatherdatabangladesh 
Then I performed preprocessing, and applied various supervised learning models such as Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, SVM, and Random Forest. Our findings demonstrate that ensemble methods and Random Forest models provide superior accuracy in handling the complexity of weather data. The repository includes data preprocessing scripts, exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation results, and conclusions that showcase the promise of machine learning in advancing weather prediction accuracy in data-scarce regions.
